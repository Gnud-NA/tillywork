# Vuetify

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) is an amazing Material design component library for Vue. It helps you create applications with opinionated components really fast, with great UX.

tillywork uses the Material Design 3 blueprint from Vuetify, for the latest design specifications and guidelines Material has.

Before contributing to tillywork, make sure to check [Vuetify's component list](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/all/) before creating your component manually, as you'll probably find it there first.
