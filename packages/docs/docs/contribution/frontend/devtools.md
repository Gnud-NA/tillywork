# VS Code and Vue

Unfortunately, the biggest downside to having a Vue application is the (sometimes) terrible VS Code extensions for Vue. Sometimes you get errors where there shouldn't be errors, other times object properties don't show as suggestions, and you get some weird behavior every now and then.

Basically, sometimes you have to ignore what VS Code is telling you and trust your experience with the framework.

If you're stuck at an issue that shouldn't be an issue, try restarting VS Code.
